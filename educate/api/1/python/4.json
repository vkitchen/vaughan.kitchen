{"total_items":14,"lesson":"\nWell done on passing your fist challenge. It wasn't really that hard was it?\n\nNow that you've mastered printing text to the screen, it's time to revisit those variables (oh boy!). They're really not that hard when you think of them like labelled packing boxes.\n\nFor this code we've started with one box labelled name. Guess what we store in that box. That's right the name of a person called \"Steve\".\n\nHow about you go ahead and make another variable called pet. In that variable store your favourite animal, be it \"Dog\", \"Cat\", \"Horse\", or \"Platypus\". After print it out on a new line.\n\nTask: add a second variable and print statement to the program\n\n","code":"# store our name in the box called name\nname = \"Steve\"\n# and get that name back\nprint name\n"}
