Well before you go ahead and say that (I know that's what you were thinking). All input starts as text. So if you want to ask someone for their age you'll still get text and not a number. If you try and use it as a number you'll either have your program crash or do weird things. So we simple convert it to a number. Behold.\n\nThat's all fine and dandy. But what happens if you ask Python for a number from something that just isn't a number. Well I don't know but you can find out.\n\nTask: convert something that isn't a number to a number\n\nTask: get two numbers from input, add them together and print them out\n\nTwo tasks this time. Aren't you lucky\n\n","total_items":14}
