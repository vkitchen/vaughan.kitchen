<h3>cocomel - A search engine</h3>
<p>A search engine implemented for fun. I have focused largely on optimizing the indexer bringing it down from an initial 2 minute runtime on the 500mb Wall Street Journal to the current 7 seconds. It''s deployed as part of my recipe search engine but still has work much to be done on it</p>
C (search engine), OCaml (web scraper)

<h3>xiangqi - Chinese Chess</h3>
<p>Originally built in 5 days of evenings as part of a work "knowledge sharing" event during covid. Most other people merely video called for their demonstration but I wanted mine to be interactive so after work hours I hacked up the game. I''ve since improved the lobby logic but haven''t gotten around to improving the performance of the game logic and putting in place the last checkmate condition (flying emperor attack). Once I get those in place I''ll add Minimax</p>

<h3>cocktails - A cocktail website</h3>
<p>Made during the period in which I was obsessed with recreating classic cocktails. I wanted a clean easy to use website which would allow me to search based off of ingredients and would only contain "classic" recipes. Eventually after being frustrated with the existing offers I hacked up my own. Originally it was written in Elm, but I rewrote it to be part of my personal website which is in C</p>

<h3>educate - A programming education platform prototype</h3>
<p>While working at Hatch tutoring children with programming I wondered if there was an easier way to get them started on focused course material and allow them to work from home. I created this prototype to explore the idea of a clean online environment focused just on the task of learning</p>

<h3>loader - Asynchronous Javascript module loader</h3>
<p>Whilst doing the web design paper at uni I wondered if there was a way to modularise the code given to us in the labs. As they had a requirement in the paper of using no outside libraries I decided to come up with a solution to that problem instead of using something off of the shelf. The result was an understandable and minimal library that was easy to develop with</p>

<h3>btpy - Client to the bittorrent protocol daemon</h3>
<p>An old project but still one that I had fun developing. In my early days of programming I used to run my own servers and play around with Linux a lot. One of the things I wanted was a better way to download the latest OS releases as soon as they happened. Our internet at the time was slow, and I impatient, if it was there before I saw the news I''d be very happy. I set about figuring out how to script a bittorrent client. Alas I never did complete my project but I enjoyed trying to figure out the protocol (through sniffing binary data) between btpd and it''s client at a time before I could read C.</p>
