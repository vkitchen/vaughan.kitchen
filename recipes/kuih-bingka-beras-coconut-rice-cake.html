<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>150g rice flour</li>
<li>42g Mung Bean flour</li>
<li>15g Tapioca flour</li>
<li>600ml Coconut milk</li>
<li>400ml Water</li>
<li>170g sugar</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>7 -10 Pandan leaves (I used frozen ones about 10 cm length)</li>
<li>Cooking oil to grease pan or greaseproof baking paper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Pour 400 ml of warm to hot water and throw in pandan leaves to infuse its essence. When cool enough to touch, I squeeze the pandan leaves a few times. Discard the pandan leaves</li>
<li>Measure all dry ingredients in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Pour initial 150 - 200 ml of the coconut milk into dry ingredients and mix to a smooth paste. Add rest of the coconut milk once you think there's no lumps. Add in the 400 ml of pandan flavoured water - stir.</li>
<li>Transfer mixture to a pot and cook over medium heat to start turning to low once you see curdling.</li>
<li>Keep stirring until it majorly starts curdling. Don’t worry about the lumpiness yet. Take off pot from heat once mixture has curdled fully and turned into a fairly dry thick paste. You'll learn the "feel" of how "dry" it needs to be for the texture you like after the first time you cook!</li>
<li>Using a strong spatula, stir out the lupiness and you can achieve a pretty smooth thick paste.</li>
<li>Grease a ll x bb baking tray with cooking oil. Be generous. Or better alternative is use baking paper!</li>
<li>Scrape paste into tray, even and smooth out and bake in preheated oven 220°C for 30 - 35 minutes</li>
<li>Let it cool before attempting to remove it. I have had some trouble with this and I think the one time I was able to remove it successfully was when I really fully cooled the kuih to room temperature or when I use baking paper.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see from the picture, there's a certain degree of "burnt". This is actually a desired effect rather than poor cooking skill. It makes it aromatic - bringing out the "roasted" coconuty smell and taste. It actually doesn't taste burnt!</p>
