<h3 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
<li>80 g Cake Flour</li>
<li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
<li>40 g Cocoa</li>
<li>5 Eggs @ 58 g each</li>
<li>130 g Sugar (divided)</li>
<li>55 g Canola Oil</li>
<li>80 g Hot Water</li>
<li>&#189; tsp Decaf Instant Coffee</li>
<li>1 tsp Vanilla</li>
<li>&#189; tsp Cream of Tartar</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Method">Method</h3>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180C. If you have a split oven use the large part and put rack in the lower 1/3 so that cake will bake in the middle of the oven</li>
<li>Make the coffe from the hot water and instant coffe. Leave to cool</li>
<li>Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder &amp; baking soda together</li>
<li>Seperate eggs. Use a bowl with a sharp edge to help make the crack cleaner and the egg easier to seperate</li>
<li>Put egg whites into freezer until just starting to form ice (about 10 min)</li>
<li>Beat egg yolks (colour will change. Add half of the sugar and continue to beat until creamy pale</li>
<li>Add oil to yolks. Mix. Add coffee and vanilla. Mix</li>
<li>Mix wet into the dry ingredients gently. Avoid over mixing as this will form gluten and ruin the soft texture</li>
<li>Begin whipping egg whites on medium with an egg beater or cake mixer</li>
<li>When large bubbles begin to form add cream of tartar down the side of the bowl continuing to whip</li>
<li>When the bubbles become small, the white has foamed, and is roughly 4 times in size begin to slowly add the sugar down the side of the bowl continuing to whip. Be gentle so as not to collapse the bubbles</li>
<li>Once added turn the beater up to high and beat until the stiff peak stage is reached (peak stays formed when drawn up with only the very tip bending over)</li>
<li>Fold the egg whites into the batter piece by piece. Once complete they should be just mixed. It is okay if they seem slightly undermixed so long as there&#8217;s no streaks</li>
<li>Bake 35-40 minutes until a skewer comes out clean. Then cool upside down on a wine bottle (if you have a bundt type pan) or on a cooling rack otherwise. This is so the cake doesn&#8217;t shrink as the air trapped inside cools</li>
<li>Once completely cool (1-2 hours) it is safe to remove from the pan. The flavour and texture is best if left for at least 24 hours in an airtight container</li>
<li>Garnish by dusting with icing sugar if you so please and enjoy :D</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You really want to be using a bundt pan/angel food pan for this cake (of heavy aluminum with a removable inner) and without greasing the pan. By sticking to the pan the cake can rise properly as it has a tendency to collapse under its own weight</li>
</ul>
