		<h1>CV - Vaughan Kitchen</h1>
		<h3>(leading a life un-styled)</h3>

		<h2>Personal</h2>
		<fieldset>
			<p>Proficient programmer in C, C++, Fortran, Perl, Python, Javascript (and React), Elm, R, OCaml</p>
			<p>Enjoys Roller skating, Cooking, History, Tramping, Gardening, Board games</p>
			<p>I have a long history of involvement with computers, becoming a linux enthusiast and then programmer during high school though I started out as a car enthusiast. I've always been interested in anything technical and would rapidly become enthralled in whatever I could get my hands on. Today I try to live a balanced lifestyle which involves reading, exercise and a preoccupation with cooking and eating healthy but delicious vegan food</p>

		<h2>Selected Works</h2>
		<fieldset>
			<h3>cocomel - A search engine</h3>
			<p>A search engine implemented for fun. I have focused largely on optimizing the indexer bringing it down from an initial 2 minute runtime on the 500mb Wall Street Journal to the current 7 seconds. It's now at a point where I'd feel comfortable to deploy it (on a small scale) but I haven't completed any projects with enough data to require a search engine.</p>

			<h3>cocktails - A cocktail website</h3>
			<p>Made during the period in which I was obsessed with recreating classic cocktails. I wanted a clean easy to use website which would allow me to search based off of ingredients and would only contain "classic" recipes. Eventually after being frustrated with the existing offers I hacked up my own</p>

			<h3>educate - A programming education platform prototype</h3>
			<p>While working at Hatch tutoring children with programming I wondered if there was an easier way to get them started on focused course material and allow them to work from home. I created this prototype to explore the idea of a clean online environment focused just on the task of learning</p>

			<h3>films - Visually display film bookmarks</h3>
			<p>I often bookmark films I want to watch in the future but I typically forget what they are. Here I can display them so that when I'm bored and wanting to watch something I can remember them</p>

			<h3>loader - Asynchronous Javascript module loader</h3>
			<p>Whilst doing the web design paper at uni I wondered if there was a way to modularise the code given to us in the labs. As they had a requirement in the paper of using no outside libraries I decided to come up with a solution to that problem instead of using something off of the shelf. The result was an understandable and minimal library that was easy to develop with</p>

			<h3>btpy - Client to the bittorrent protocol daemon</h3>
			<p>An old project but still one that I had fun developing. In my early days of programming I used to run my own servers and play around with Linux a lot. One of the things I wanted was a better way to download the latest OS releases as soon as they happened. Our internet at the time was slow, and I impatient, if it was there before I saw the news I'd be very happy. I set about figuring out how to script a bittorrent client. Alas I never did complete my project but I enjoyed trying to figure out the protocol (through sniffing binary data) between btpd and it's client at a time before I could read C.</p>
